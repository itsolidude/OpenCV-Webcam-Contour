# OpenCV Threshold Adjustment Project

## Project Overview

This repository hosts my initial project with OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. The core functionality of this project is to implement a tracker bar for dynamic threshold adjustments in real-time image processing. Currently in development, the project aims to address challenges such as varying light conditions, which can affect the accuracy and stability of threshold-based operations.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Incorporates a tracker bar allowing users to adjust threshold values interactively to fine-tune image processing results.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Utilizes a live video feed to apply threshold adjustments and observe changes in real-time.
- **Lighting Condition Challenges:** Actively being refined to better handle and adapt to changes in lighting conditions, which currently present a challenge to consistent image processing.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python:** The project is developed in Python, leveraging its simplicity and powerful libraries in computer vision.
- **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):** Used for real-time computer vision operations, particularly in tracking and threshold adjustments.
- **Background Subtraction:** Employing OpenCV's background subtraction methods for isolating moving objects in the video feed.
